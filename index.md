## 21:00 -- Wednesday April 15th, 2020

Ran into our old neighbors Cat and David tonight (with a good ten foot buffer due to social distancing) and found out they bake their own bread. She offered me some of her sourdough starter and I gladly accepted it.

Now I'm thirty minutes into reading sourdough bread recipes and how to maintain the starter and feeling like I'm joining a cult. For tonight I've decided to just put the starter in the refrigerator overnight so I can read more before diving in.

## 20:00 -- Thursday April 16th, 2020

The more I read the more overwhelmed I get! I've decided to tackle just one thing at a time starting with learning how to feed the starter.

1. I put a 32oz takeout container on my kitchen scale and noted it weighs 32 grams before I zeroed out the scale.
1. With the scale at zero I poured in 50 grams of starter into my takeout container from the jar our old neighbor gave me and put the jar with the remaining starter back in the refrigerator.
1. Next I poured in 50 grams of bread flour into the takeout container. I'm using King Arthur bread flour which has 12.7% protein content.
1. Then I poured in 50 grams of room temperature water into the takeout container.
1. Now I stirred it up really good with a spatula. Next time I'm going pour in the water first, stir it up to thin out the starter, then add the flour and stir.
1. Finally, I covered it with plastic wrap, then a wet towel, and stuck it in the warmest place in our house overnight (playroom bathroom near the heat vent with the bathroom door closed).

## 08:30 -- Friday April 17th, 2020

The starter I fed last night more than doubled in size! Time to feed it
again.

1. I zero out my scale with an empty takeout container, then put container of starter I fed last night on the scale and confirm it weighs what it did last night, 150 grams (50g starter + 50g flour + 50g water).
1. I added 150 grams of room temperature water and mixed it up to thin out the starter.
1. Then I added 150 grams of bread flour and stirred things up.
1. Finally, I put the plastic wrap and wet towel back on and stuck it in the kitchen window to stay warm all day.

## 20:30 -- Friday April 17th, 2020

I probably should have considered that this thing would hit the plastic wrap at the top if it more than doubled in size again

So yeah, I've got 450 grams of starter now that fills a 32oz container to the lid. I haven't picked out a bread recipe, so I have no idea how much I'll need.

That said I've accomplished my goal; I know how to feed a sourdough starter! I'm going to feed it one more time tonight and then try using it in a recipe tomorrow.

1. I poured 75 grams of starter into a container.
1. Then 75 grams of room temperature water and stirred it up.
1. Then 75 grams of bread flour and stirred it up.
1. I repeated the process with a second container since I had so much starter.
1. Covered each container and placed in a warm spot overnight.
1. Stuck the remaining starter, about 150 grams worth, into the refrigerator.

All of the bread recipes I'm reading require 6-12 hours of fermentation after mixing the starter with flour, water, and salt and I'm too tired tonight to get that going so I'll figure out next steps in the morning.

## 07:30 -- Saturday April 18th, 2020

Ok, now I've got two containers with 225 grams of starter each ready to use on the counter and 150 grams leftover from last night plus 50 grams still from what our old neighbor gave us both sitting in the refrigerator.

Last night before bed I started watching sourdough tips on YouTube and learned about the magic bread ratios. The recipe hydration is determined by the ratio of water to flour, so this recipe would be 80% hydration:

-   1000 grams flour
-   800 grams water
-   150 grams starter
-   20 grams salt

I also learned that I'll probably want to start with a lower hydration percentage, maybe 50-60% instead of 80%, because the dough will be easier to work with as a novice.

**But this is all getting too much into the weeds. I'm not ready to bake bread yet. I need to make something simple and it would be great if I could use some of this starter instead of discarding it after I feed it again this morning.**

It's Saturday morning which is the perfect time to make pancakes! Can I make pancakes with sourdough starter?

Sourdough starter pancakes:

1. 250 grams of starter
1. 1 egg
1. 1 tbsp maple syrup
1. 1 tbsp oil (I used canola)
1. ¼ tsp salt
1. ¼ tsp baking soda
1. ½ tsp baking powder

Heat skillet on medium heat. Mix all ingredients in a bowl. Pour ¼ cup of batter for each pancake. Cook for 2-3 minutes and then flip and cook for another minute and then serve. Makes about 6 pancakes.

These pancakes were so good! I'm really getting the hang of this, I can feed my starter and I can even cook something with it!

Time to start preparing my dough! As I understand it right now these are the basic steps:

1. Mix water and flour in a large bowl.
1. Let it rest for 30 minutes.
1. Mix in starter, salt, and maybe oil.
1. Work the dough into a ball.
1. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and put it in a warm environment.
1. Let it bulk ferment for 3-12 hours.
  - Optionally stretch and fold every hour for the first few hours during bulk fermentation. You can stretch and fold by gathering a portion of the dough from one side, stretch it upwards and then fold it over itself. Rotate the bowl a ¼ turn and repeat the process until you come full circle. Repeat this process until the dough is tensed up and doesn't want to stretch, usually 10-20 times. This strengthens the dough and increases the total volume of the bread.
  - Bulk fermentation is done when the dough has doubled in size.
1. If you are going to cut the dough in half to make two loaves put some flour on one area of your counter and put the dough on the flour and then cut it with a bench scraper.
1. Shape the dough on a clean counter.
1. Let it rise for 1-2 hours.
1. Bake it!

Tonight I'm following the Sourdough Bread: A Beginner's Guide recipe by Emilie Raffa. This recipe was a little different in that it had me mix the starter with water and oil, then add the flour and salt and then let it set to autolyse for 30 minutes.

I'm also wondering why it has such a low hydration level, only 50%. The YouTube video I watched last night recommended 70% for a beginner and said 80% would be too hard to handle but 50% is just downright dry. I wonder if this will by tight crummy bread :thinking:

## 08:00 -- Sunday April 19th, 2020

Today is the day! This morning I checked on my dough and it had risen nicely so I proceeded to cut it into two pieces and then shaped them per the instructions in Sourdough Bread: A Beginner's Guide.

They are now doing the second rest before I slash the tops and start baking them. Since I only have one Dutch Oven, I'll only be cooking one loaf at a time.

Now I'm working on breakfast. Just put bacon in the oven with a teaspoon of brown sugar on each slice. Next up is preparing another batch of sourdough pancakes because the ones yesterday were so yummy.

I did it! Photos in reverse order.

![cross section, some air pockets, looks pretty good for first attempt]({{ site.url }}/images/p2-crumb.jpg)

The recipe made two small rounds.

![after bake on the left, before bake on the right]({{ site.url }}/images/p3-before-and-after-bake.jpg)

This was taken during the final proof. Shaping the dough was a lot easier than I thought it would be.

Right after the bulk fermentation and before I cut it in half and started shaping.

This bread is delicious. I gave the second loaf to our friend Daryl and we're using our loaf tonight for dinner (steak, asparagus, tomatoes, and bread all grilled) so I'm itching to make more already :smile:

I think I'll get another batch of this recipe started after the kids go to bed tonight and I'll bake the loaves in the morning before work. I might swap 25% of the white bread flour for some whole wheat flour and increase the hydration level from 50% to 60%.
